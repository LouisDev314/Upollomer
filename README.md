## General Description of Startup ##

This is an online platform that allows people to discover opportunities by uploading and actualizing their ideas in a mutually beneficial way through the participation of the community. This is different from any current existing platforms because contributions can be made decentralized. This will be achieved by two-way social networking with profiles set up based on abilities and specialized skills: creators can post ideas and recruit teammates to implement ideas, or to connect with people who have matched abilities or academic background that interests them; others in the community can find ideas that interest them and participate through building connections with the creators. Also, feasible resources will be provided for idea implementation (factories, office sites, investors contacts, etc.). Since this platform agglomerate resources, the networking cost is lowered, like-minded people can be connected through ideas, share the same enthusiasms, and broadening social circles and horizons at the same time. 

"If you canâ€™t get your opportunities, you can just create your own"

"Alter opportunities to try their skills with projects, to prove their skills, experience built from here can be used to apply for job for future use"

"Contest and create better skills in here"

"Easier to participate in ideas that comes from all around the world"

## Business Model/Value and Market Landscape ##

This platform is to solve the problem/pain point that a lot of university or high school students who do not have the chance to see how they can apply their knowledge acquired from education and to increase the efficiency of networking today. The target customers of this platform will be universities students, fresh graduates, and high school students, aged from 15 to 25, without heavy financial burden, have specialized skills and wanted to test themselves or gain actual application experience in production environment through implementing various project ideas raised in the community with each other. Furthermore, for students to discover their potentials as the creativity and practical aspects, and to team up with like-minded people, get to know each other and networking based on technical skills. Different from traditional crowdsourcing networking platforms, such as social media like Facebook and Instagram, which are mostly being used to connect friends based on interest; professional networking platform like LinkedIn, which only provides 'one-way' networking that is for recruiters to find candidates and users are restricted from freely connect with other professionals, our platform will allow all users to freely connect with each other, students can post their concepts or ideas as projects on this platform, then, to find other students who have the skills required to implement the ideas; for other students with different skills, they can participate the projects either, therefore, the networking is achieved in 'two-way' project- and ability-based.

This platform is free for everyone to access and register to get access to feasible resources that are required to achieve ideas, such as, manufacturers for mass production, investors and collaboration with crowdfunding platforms. To provide services, keep updating the design, built-in features, and functions to increase the stickiness of users, the cost of manpower to maintain the platform is required. Also, to let students who are considering starting their own projects or want to participate in any to try out their skills can find this online platform, there will be marketing costs from putting advertisements on social media and apps most university students are using, like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. to allow both students and suppliers to discover this platform when they are browsing.

As income, this platform will invite manufacturers/suppliers to join our platform by paying advertising fee and accompanied by advertisements paid by identified sponsors. Moreover, since this platform is highly skill-based, the data from users for businesses/sponsors to put ads will be targeted precisely as an incentive to attract sponsorships. After consideration, the business model will be profitable due to the comparatively lower cost that is recoverable by the income and advantages of recurrent business, the platform, users and suppliers can grow together due to mutual benefits.

## Technology Involved/ to be Adopted ##

The programming languages involved are HTML5, CSS3, EJS, Node.js, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code. MySQL, Python will be adopted in the future. The platform will also use MongoDB as the cloud database to store all the information, and the platform will be implemented through Heroku, which is a free domain tool that provides a domain for websites as a production environment. The techniques involved are web design, software design and engineering, network programming and CRUD.

## Execution and Development Plan ##

All the essential functions, such as login, register, view of ideas and other users, etc., will be achieved for the platform to function as a prototype first. Then, new and optional functions will be added based on the result of conductive research and feedback of the prototype that will be issued later. Meanwhile, CSS will be applied to increase the aesthetics level of the platform. Since the scale of the user base is critical, to promote the platform, we will provide users who shared the platform via invitation code access to limited features. Thus, there will be an increasing number of users and leads to a larger user base, let the word-of-mouth spread and advocate the platform. The development of this platform will apply agile methodology, test-first development, and continuous refactoring and integration with a daily scrum to keep building prototypes and demo versions and update them through iterations to prevent all the disadvantages of traditional waterfall methodology.

This platform will continue to agglomerate resources into one platform to lower the cost of starting the implementation of the idea and joining the platform to allow people more willing to join and start everything (networking, finding like-minded, matched abilities) right away. In the future, the platform will not only be serving Hong Kong students but students from all around the world. Moreover, there will be a professional version of it for people who want to do a start-up to use, which will have more professional functions and features to be developed. The goal is to allow students to take the initiative to discover their own value and capability among creative ideas and passionate communities and unleash their potential to create an innovative future eventually. Provoke innovation, nurture entrepreneurship, and promote connection in communities.

## About myself ##

I am Louis, current Junior Computational Media student. Has strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills, easy-going and dedicated. Have object-oriented programming, backend and frontend development background. The web is built with Node.js, javascript, ejs, NO SQL with MongoDB in an MVC model, which helps me to maintain a good code architecture.

Want to explore the possibility to turn my idea into a successful start-up because I think entrepreneurship is the key that leads human beings to have a brighter future with posterity and I want to foster that.

The idea popped up in my mind when I understand what blockchain is, and thought about the potential behind it, which is way beyond to just use for cryptocurrency, or smart contracts, it can be used to contribute to human beings, storing and sharing knowledge that different people have, as nodes on a blockchain, and just to cluster them, we can create a great future. The concept behind is more to promote entrepreneurship, and I hope to build this website to lower the costs to initiate dreams by agglomerating resources for people, especially students to use immediately.
